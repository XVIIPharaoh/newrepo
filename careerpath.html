                        A career in computer science opens numerous career pathways. With just a bachelor’s degree, 
                        a job seeker can get into coding and programming. But the employment options for computer science 
                        majors extend beyond that. They can go into technical writing, software development and engineering, 
                        systems management, network administration, and even cybersecurity.

                            is why it’s a popular career option for those with a master’s in computer science.
