                        Computers has helped the world progress at an accelerated pace and because of that 
                        it has improved the life quality of people around the world. To continue to improve
                        quality of living we need to computer scientists to continue to create such machines.
                        Here are some of the ways computer scientists has made a difference in the world.

                            There are so many aspects to where the healthcare industry benefited from computer science
                            let’s start with keeping track of records. The hospitals use a database created by computer 
                            scientists to keep track of patients and their medical records. Another is the machines used 
                            by the staff of the like machine used to check blood pressure, defibrillators, cat scans, heartbeat
                            monitor, and much more. Computer Scientist has made a huge impact in the healthcare industry 
                            and continue to farther influence as time progress on.

                            Before there were computers the only way to learn was to physically go to a school and listen 
                            to a teacher give a lesson, but now in today’s society we have computers and can listen to a 
                            lesson given by the teacher from anywhere. Also, schools use databases to keep track of students, faculty members,
                            grades, attendance, and so on.

                            The environment is always a hot topic when it comes to pollution and deforestation. Here's how the technology
                            Computer Scientist make helps with the deforestation issue. Before the best way to keep track of information was 
                            to write it down on paper which a lot of people was doing. This led to an increase in demand and lead to an absurd amount 
                            of tress getting cut down to please the demands. Now we have another way to store data and it doesn't involve in cutting 
                            down trees. When now store information on our computers that were made by Computer Scientist to make data storing a 
                            little greener.

                            Quick communication is a big advancement today. In earlier times communicating with someone in a different
                            state would take weeks if not months depending on how far the distance. Also, news was slow to travel back in the day so getting important information
                            to the public on the other side of the country. Fast forward to now where you can get a hold of someone on the other side of the country in 
                            a few moments is a significant difference. This is possibly because of the technology Computer Scientist made to better communications.
