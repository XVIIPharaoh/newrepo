<button class="accordione" >Determine What Computer Science Means to You</button>
<div class="panele">
  <p class="note">To prepare your self to be a computer sciense first you have to find out what computer science mean to you, 
    what ever computer science mean to you, hold on it carefully because it will give yu the perseverance you need when things becom tough(when,not if)and 
    find out what your speciallized 
    interested in computer science is, whether the algorithm, computer security or software engineering and fully imprese yourself
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordione">Know Your Resources</button>
<div class="panele">
  <p class="note">If you're looking for even more supplemental resources before taking courses in a university, 
    look into the cheaper e-book versions of textbooks used at various universities. 
    The Internet has an abundance of resources and information. Use them to your benefit!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordione">Train Your Mental Discipline</button>
<div class="panele">
  <p class="note">It takes a lot of practice to become good in programming, so if you want to succeed in university, you need start early. Long hours spent staring at a screen, planning your code, 
    or analyzing a problem set can be uncomfortable. Create a programming schedule, then follow it. To enter into The Flow,
     identify your programming habits and triggers. Do what feels right for you, whether that's working while listening to music through headphones, sipping on a hot cup of coffee,
     or studying or working in an area where other people are also studying (like a library).</p>
</div>
<button class="accordione">Don't expect to learn everything during courses</button>
<div class="panele">
  <p class="note">All of the IT and computer science courses are fantastic. They will not, however, cover every skill required for employment.
    For example, if you want to work in software development, you might need to learn more programming languages than that. 
    You may have to figure out and learn new programming languages on your own if there is no teaching. Searching for tutorials for
    popular online programming languages such as Python, MATLAB, Java, and others—some of which are even free.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordione">IStudying the night before a deadline will NOT work</button>
<div class="panele">
  <p class="note">Try to complete your assignment well before the deadline; ideally, prepare them a week in advance. Otherwise, you'll become exhausted,
    your code will fail, and you'll fail the assignment. Computer science and information technology are two fields where it is critical to keep working 
    throughout the semester because there will be times when you will need to take a break to 
   better understand why something isn't working. As a courtesy to yourself, work throughout the semester.</p>
